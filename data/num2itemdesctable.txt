[Kunlun The Hermit Land]				
Kunlun is a land in the clouds.  
Being so high in the air affords an unprecedented view of the world, it also gives 
a different mindset to those whom allow themselves to think freely.  
The ^ff0000Statue of Kunlun's Greatest Philosopher^000000, stands proudly in the middle of town, ready to
inspire great thoughts from all those that gaze upon him.  All around Kunlun are spectacular ^ff0000Overlooks of the World^000000.  
But there are particular spots that are exceptionally breathtaking, please watch your step.
There is a ^ff0000small hill in Kunlun^000000 that is said to of been the Great Philosophers favorite meditation spot, 
you should visit there and see if any grand thoughts take you.  
No matter how great a culture is, there will always be a few among its citizenry that just don't 'get it'. 
Those in Kunlun's history that always thought small eventually truly shrank, and eventually disappeared.  
But before that time they had a ^ff0000Mini-town^000000 that they lived in on ground beneath Kunlun.  
That place is an object lesson against stagnant thinking.

and Faith for healing, the Louyang healers practice their art at a '^ff0000Hospital^000000'.  
At a Hospital, your body will be cured by a system of body manipulations and diet.  
The beautiful ^ff0000Palace^000000 that is protected by the Great Wall of Louyang is truly a sight to behold for every visitor.  
To go along with their proud heritage of Martial Arts and spirit training, they often practice making their bodies 
more robust through exercise. Some of these exercises target the legs others the Lungs.  
Outside Louyang some practice their ^ff0000Shouting on the Tower^000000.  If you have seen all these sites in Louyang,
you will have quite a few good memories to take home.
